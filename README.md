File Icons
==========

This is the source for the [File-Icons](https://github.com/file-icons/atom) package's custom icon-font.

## Contribution
Please [submit a request](https://github.com/file-icons/source/issues) if an icon is missing.

Library and plugin icons do - most likely - not qualify for addition as this is "a slippery slope that could end up bloating this font with the icons of literally any JS project that has a logo" ([#20](https://github.com/file-icons/source/issues/20)).
